About redzed
============

The project:

- The name was derived from "edzed" which is the predecessor library we are replacing.
  Redzed's development was based on the experience gathered during the work on edzed
  and with edzed. Redzed has the same capabilities, but is based on simpler concepts.
  It is smaller, easier to learn and easier to use.
- Redzed was written by Vlado Potisk, a software developer from Slovakia.
- Any help with the documentation is appreciated, especially with the English language
  and grammar.

Known issues:

- As always, there are probably bugs.
- The unit tests that checks proper timing may fail on heavily loaded systems.
  Please repeat failed tests.
